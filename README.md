# My Portfolio

Welcome to my up-to-date portfolio! This project showcases my skills and expertise using the latest technologies such as Next.js 13, TypeScript, JavaScript, and it is hosted on Vercel.

## About the Project

This portfolio is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that offers a great developer experience and fast performance. It is bootstrapped with create-next-app, making it easy to set up and start developing right away. The project also utilizes TypeScript, providing type safety and improving code quality.

### Getting Started

To run the development server locally, follow these steps:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

### Font Optimization

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform, created by the makers of Next.js. For more details, check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
