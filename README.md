# My Portfolio

Welcome to my up-to-date portfolio! This project showcases my skills and expertise using the latest technologies such as Next.js 13, TypeScript, JavaScript, and it is hosted on Vercel. You can visit my website at [joelsamson.com](https://joelsamson.com).

## About the Project

This portfolio is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that offers a great developer experience and fast performance. It is bootstrapped with create-next-app, making it easy to set up and start developing right away. The project also utilizes TypeScript, providing type safety and improving code quality.

### Getting Started

To run the development server locally, follow these steps:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

### Font Optimization

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
